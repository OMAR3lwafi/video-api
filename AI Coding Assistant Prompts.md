4. **AWS S3 Storage** (Public video hosting with lifecycle management)
5. **Orchestrator Service** (Intelligent workflow and resource management)
6. **Infrastructure** (Docker containerization and deployment)

### Key Features to Implement
- **Dual Response System**: Immediate URLs (â‰¤30 seconds) or Job IDs (>30 seconds)
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Live progress tracking via Supabase subscriptions
- **Intelligent Processing**: FFmpeg-based video manipulation with overlay positioning
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 integration with public URL generation
- **Advanced Orchestration**: Resource management, load balancing, and health monitoring
