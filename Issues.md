## Issues Identified
1. [❌] Backend TypeScript Errors : Primarily related to strict TypeScript configuration and missing type constraints
2. [❌] Frontend TypeScript Errors : JSX syntax issues and React component structure problems
3. [❌] Security Vulnerabilities : Both projects have npm audit warnings (4 backend, 6 frontend)
4. [❌] Optimistic updates working: No optimistic updates are implemented; UI updates follow state store changes.
5. [❌] Timeout and cancellation working (Timeout is implemented, but cancellation is not): Timeouts are set, but request cancellation is
       missing.
