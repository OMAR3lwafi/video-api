You are tasked with building a complete Dynamic Video Content Generation Platform - a full-stack application that allows users to create custom video content by combining multiple media elements (videos, images, logos) with precise positioning and automatic fitting. This is a production-ready system with intelligent dual response capabilities, AWS S3 storage integration, real-time progress tracking, and advanced orchestration.

System Architecture Summary
The platform consists of six integrated components:

Backend API (Node.js + Express + TypeScript + FFmpeg)
Database Layer (Supabase PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions)
Frontend Interface (React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS)
AWS S3 Storage (Public video hosting with lifecycle management)
Orchestrator Service (Intelligent workflow and resource management)
Infrastructure (Docker containerization and deployment)
Key Features to Implement
Dual Response System: Immediate URLs (â‰¤30 seconds) or Job IDs (>30 seconds)
Real-time Status Updates: Live progress tracking via Supabase subscriptions
Intelligent Processing: FFmpeg-based video manipulation with overlay positioning
Cloud Storage: AWS S3 integration with public URL generation
Advanced Orchestration: Resource management, load balancing, and health monitoring
Scalable Architecture: Container-ready with monitoring and analytics
Technology Stack
Backend: Node.js 18+, Express.js, TypeScript, FFmpeg, fluent-ffmpeg
Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zustand state management
Database: Supabase PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions
Storage: AWS S3 with public read access
Infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose
Processing: FFmpeg for video manipulation
Monitoring: Winston logging, Prometheus metrics (advanced)
Expected Deliverables
By the end of this process, you will have created:

Complete backend API with video processing capabilities
Real-time PostgreSQL database with comprehensive schema
Modern React frontend with dual response handling
AWS S3 integration for video storage and public URLs
Intelligent orchestration system for resource management
Docker containerization for easy deployment
Comprehensive monitoring and health check systems
Full API documentation and deployment guides
Development Approach
Foundation First: Set up project structure, environment, and basic configurations
Component Development: Build each system component with full functionality
Integration: Connect all components with proper error handling
Production Readiness: Add monitoring, security, and deployment capabilities
Success Criteria
The system is considered complete when:

Users can upload media and create custom videos successfully
Processing responds immediately (â‰¤30s) for simple jobs or provides job tracking for complex ones
All processed videos are stored in AWS S3 with public URLs
Real-time status updates work correctly via database subscriptions
System handles errors gracefully with proper user feedback
All components are containerized and deployment-ready
Instructions for Following Sequential Prompts
After reviewing this comprehensive overview, you will receive sequential prompts numbered 1 through approximately 50. Each prompt focuses on building a specific component or functionality.

Important Guidelines:
Complete Each Prompt Fully: Implement all requested functionality before moving to the next
Follow the Exact Specifications: Each prompt contains precise requirements from the PRD documents
Maintain Consistency: Use the same naming conventions, patterns, and architecture throughout
Include Error Handling: Every component should have proper error handling and logging
Add Comments: Document your code clearly for maintainability
Validation Required: After each prompt, you'll receive a checklist to validate completion
Response Format for Each Prompt:
## Prompt [Number] - [Title]
[Provide complete implementation]

## Files Created/Modified:
- List all files you created or modified
- Include brief description of each file's purpose

## Key Features Implemented:
- List the main functionality added
- Highlight any important technical decisions

## Dependencies Added:
- List any new npm packages or external dependencies
- Explain why each dependency was chosen

## Testing Notes:
- Provide basic testing instructions
- Include any setup requirements

## Ready for Next Prompt: âœ…
Validation Process:
After each prompt completion, wait for the validation checklist. Only proceed to the next prompt after confirming all checklist items are completed.

Error Handling:
If any prompt is unclear or you encounter issues:

Ask specific clarifying questions
Provide alternative approaches if specifications seem problematic
Flag any potential conflicts with previous implementations
Final Integration:
The last few prompts will focus on:

System integration testing
Docker containerization
Deployment preparation
Documentation completion

Are you ready to begin with Prompt 1?
